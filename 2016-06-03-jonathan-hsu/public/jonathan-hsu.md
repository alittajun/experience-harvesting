_Q: What are some of the characteristics of data scientists who continue to grow beyond IC work as the company scales?_

Broadly speaking, all functions within a company exist because they are created to support the survival of the organization, and the desire to win. Engineering leverages technology to provide competitive edge, Finance leverages financial instrument to make sure the business is operating efficiently. Data Science leverage data to make data informed decisions. They all do different things, but the overarching goal is the same - to win! 

Those who can recognize this fact will pay more attentions to the broader picture, and whoever can support that desire to win will stand out and grow with the organization. They focus on impact, rather than the technique. Read Chamath's [Facebook Exit Letter](https://medium.com/@chamath/farewell-facebook-b83d6a7eae29#.khw63oii7) to get inspired!

_Q: How to make career choices?_


* **Choose your battle wisely**: This happens a lot when they evaluate companies. Spaces that are super crowded are hard to suceed (He uses data startups as an example - extremely crowded, hard to win the space). For individuals, a lot of the choices you make boils down to which company to join.

* **Time**: When you are young, your most important asset is time, not money. Spend your time wisely.

* **We are all looking for 10x return, implicitly**: In most cases though, we tend to be much more conservative, and in reality we make decisions and pick options that give us 1.2 - 1.3x returns top. Know your risk profile, and choose accordingly. 

* **Be a Builder**: Build things, and find opportunities to build things that outlive you. 

_On Building Skills_

* **Go broad as much as you can**: Being an IC, it's very easy to get locked down on learning the next modeling technique, the next programming languages, and the next X... etc. Being able to see the holistic picture makes you more valuable. Read a lot, expose to many things.

* **Premium of Creation**: Our society fundamentally value those who create. Think of classical pianist, Lizst, Rachmoniff ...etc. They are long lasting not just because they are great recitalist, but also because of their composition. They create things that others can not, and people love them.
