# Project Plan Document

## Overarching Goal:

The goal of experience harvesting is mutliple fold. For a long time, I have been trying to design my career path on my own. While it is a fun exercise to piece all the puzzles together, it's not entirely clear that this is the most efficient approach to career development. I have had a few experience where asking the helps of domain experts really help me to gather most of the information that I would need, in a very short time. I am also at an age where I cannot easily try anything or everything that I am interested in. As a result, learning from the experience from others, especially those who are ahead of me in similar career paths is a smart idea. 

Furthermore, this is not going to be a one way street. By talking to people, we will be able to share common experiences and differences in opinions. I believe these kind of conversations will spark new thoughts, ideas, and frameworks, so it's mutually beneficial. The long term effect is that if you have a few allies who share the same practice, they become the network intelligence that you can rely on and tap into when it comes to difficult decisions. 

As a result, my 2016 goals is to be a lot more aggressive in doing experience harvesting. Here are the main goals for this projects:

* **Career Research / Data Driven Planning**
	* Identify the success factors of other outstanding Data Scientists
	* Continue to update my belief about the landscape of DS (e.g. Type A v.s. Type B)

* **Build my network**
	* Build the network and cross pollinate 
	* Tap into the network intelligence

* **Seek Mentors**
	* Narrow down to a selected few - "board of directors"
	* Engage and figure out who your mentors are

## Frameworks

### On Career Research

The backbone of this exercise is from Cal Newport and Scott Young. There are generally several steps in carrying out a successful career research exercise:

* **Background Research**: Understand the background of your interviewee like a book. Construct the timeline of their career path so you have a basic understanding of their profiles

* **Contact**: Initiate the conversation, do the necessary work to maximize your chance of having an interview. Be cognizant of other people's time

* **Interview**: Prepare your top 3 questions, take notes, don't process them on the spot. Ask if you can follow up

* **Analysis**: After conducting the interview, do differential analysis. Separate circumstances from skills, skill/habit/asset framework.

* **Document**: Properly document the learnings without exposing other people's privacy

* **Follow-up**: Ask to follow up, make sure you show progress

### On Buidling Networks

Framework is based on Reid Hoffman's "the startup of you":

* Relationships matter to your career no matter the organization or your level of seniority because, utlimately, every job boils down to interacting with people. People control resources, opportunities, information and the like.

* People you spent time with shape the person you are today and the person you aspire to be tomorrow. Equation I^We. An individual's power is raised exponentially with the help of a network

* Two types of professional relationships:
	* **Allies**: people you consult regularly for advice. You trust their judgement. You proactively collaborate. You keep your antenna especially attuned to an ally's interests. You promote his or her brand. You defend them.
	* **Weaker Ties and Acquantiances**: they introduce diversity. Your network is more diverse than you think, so meet and greet

* Relationship is like a living organism, if they're not getting stronger, they're getting weaker. Strengthen relationships by sending articles, making introductions, collaborating on projects, and staying in touch.

* Join clubs and conferences. Even better, start your own.

### On Mentoring

Here are a few Quora answers that articulate what constitute a good mentor-mentee relationship:

* **Mutually understood goals**: Prior to entering into a relationship, the mentee, or the person matchmaking the mentor/mentee should be able to communicate the goals of the relationship.

* **Mentee-driven**: The mentee should be the person driving the schedule and the discussion topics

* **Bandwidth-appropriate**: Beaware of the time involved in both party, be respectful of other people's time.

* **A focus on approaches, not tactics**: Work with them to build mental models and frameworks that will pay dividends throughout your career. The most productive discussions may start from a narrow topic, but usually turn a little more abstract rather than staying narrow.

* **A focus on listening**: As a mentee, you’re better served by milking examples, ideas and learnings out of your mentor, and then leveraging your mentor to help apply them to your space

* **Transparency**: It may take a few meetings to build the trust necessary to give this type of candid feedback, but try to get there quickly

* **Dissolved appropriately**: A mentee shouldn’t be afraid to explicitly dial down the frequency of meetings or stop them entirely.

## Project & Performance Metrics

### Project Metrics

* Set up a regular cadence to interview people (Every two weeks)
* Come up with a SOP for research, contact, interview, analysis, document, follow-up

### Performance Metrics

* **Experience Harvesting / Data Driven Planning**
	* Identify 1 critical skill for Type A DS & Type B DS
	* Try to integrate (or plan) these skills into your on the job training

* **Build my network**
	* The network should be large and close enough that I can host a DS meetup (like the one Samson and I talk about)

* **Seek Mentors**
	* Identify a narrow set of candidates as mentors
	* Reach: Start a mentor-mentee relationship with one person
