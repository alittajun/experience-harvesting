# Project Plan Document

## Overarching Goal:

The goal of experience harvesting is mutliple fold. For a long time, I have been trying to design my career path on my own. While it is a fun exercise to piece all the puzzles together, it's not entirely clear that this is the most efficient approach to career development. I have had a few experience where asking the helps of domain experts really help me to gather most of the information that I would need, in a very short time. I am also at an age where I cannot easily try anything or everything that I am interested in. As a result, learning from the experience from others, especially those who are ahead of me in similar career paths is a smart idea. 

Furthermore, this is not going to be a one way street. By talking to people, we will be able to share common experiences and differences in opinions. I believe these kind of conversations will spark new thoughts, ideas, and frameworks, so it's mutually beneficial. The long term effect is that if you have a few allies who share the same practice, they become the network intelligence that you can rely on and tap into when it comes to difficult decisions. 

As a result, my 2016 goals is to be a lot more aggressive in doing experience harvesting. Here are the main goals for this projects:

* **Career Research / Data Driven Planning**
	* Identify the success factors of other outstanding Data Scientists
	* Continue to update my belief about the landscape of DS (e.g. Type A v.s. Type B)

* **Build my network**
	* Build the network and cross pollinate 
	* Tap into the network intelligence

* **Seek Mentors**
	* Narrow down to a selected few - "board of directors"
	* Engage and figure out who your mentors are

## Frameworks

### On Career Research

The backbone of this exercise is from Cal Newport and Scott Young. There are generally several steps in carrying out a successful career research exercise:

* **Background Research**: Understand the background of your interviewee like a book. Construct the timeline of their career path so you have a basic understanding of their profiles

* **Contact**: Initiate the conversation, do the necessary work to maximize your chance of having an interview. Be cognizant of other people's time

* **Interview**: Prepare your top 3 questions, take notes, don't process them on the spot. Ask if you can follow up

* **Analysis**: After conducting the interview, do differential analysis. Separate circumstances from skills, skill/habit/asset framework.

* **Document**: Properly document the learnings without exposing other people's privacy

* **Follow-up**: Ask to follow up, make sure you show progress

### On Buidling Networks

Reid Hoffman's "the startup of you"?

### On Mentoring

Here are a few Quora answers that articulate what constitute a good mentor-mentee relationship:

* **Mutually understood goals**: Prior to entering into a relationship, the mentee, or the person matchmaking the mentor/mentee should be able to communicate the goals of the relationship.

* **Mentee-driven**: The mentee should be the person driving the schedule and the discussion topics

* **Bandwidth-appropriate**: Beaware of the time involved in both party, be respectful of other people's time.

* **A focus on approaches, not tactics**: Work with them to build mental models and frameworks that will pay dividends throughout your career. The most productive discussions may start from a narrow topic, but usually turn a little more abstract rather than staying narrow.

* **A focus on listening**: As a mentee, you’re better served by milking examples, ideas and learnings out of your mentor, and then leveraging your mentor to help apply them to your space

* **Transparency**: It may take a few meetings to build the trust necessary to give this type of candid feedback, but try to get there quickly

* **Dissolved appropriately**: A mentee shouldn’t be afraid to explicitly dial down the frequency of meetings or stop them entirely.

## Project & Performance Metrics

### Project Metrics

* Set up a regular cadence to interview people (Every two weeks)
* Come up with a SOP for research, contact, interview, analysis, document, follow-up

### Performance Metrics

* **Experience Harvesting / Data Driven Planning**
	* Identify 1 critical skill for Type A DS & Type B DS
	* Try to integrate (or plan) these skills into your on the job training

* **Build my network**
	* The network should be large and close enough that I can host a DS meetup (like the one Samson and I talk about)

* **Seek Mentors**
	* Identify a narrow set of candidates as mentors
	* Reach: Start a mentor-mentee relationship with one person
