# Project Plan Document

## Overarching Goal:

The goal of experience-harvesting is mutliple fold. For a long time, I have been trying to figure things out on my own. While noble, it's not entirely clear that this is the most efficient way to acquire knowledge or learning a new topic. I've found that while it is important to structure your own thoughts, getting constant feedbacks is the key to improvement. On the other hand, it's important to tap into the intelligence of your network when making decisions, like what Reid Hoffman suggested. I have been pretty bad at this in the past, so one of my goals in 2016 is to aggressively build and nurture relationships. Here are the top level goals of this project:

* **Experience Harvesting / Data Driven Planning**
	* Figure out the success factors of other outstanding Data Scientists
	* Translate those success factors into skills that you need to double down on
	* Update your belief about the landscape of the DS field

* **Build my network**
	* Start building an nurturing an allie of DS
	* Ask for their advice and opinions on DS related questions

* **Seek Mentors**
	* Nurture relationships
	* Narrow down to a selected few - "board of directors"

## Some Background Reading

Here are a few Quora answers that I think pin down the essence of a good mentor-mentee relationship

* **Mutually understood goals**: Prior to entering into a relationship, the mentee, or the person matchmaking the mentor/mentee should be able to communicate the goals of the relationship.

* **Mentee-driven**: The mentee should be the person driving the schedule and the discussion topics

* **Bandwidth-appropriate**: Beaware of the time involved in both party, be respectful of other people's time.

* **A focus on approaches, not tactics**: Work with them to build mental models and frameworks that will pay dividends throughout your career. The most productive discussions may start from a narrow topic, but usually turn a little more abstract rather than staying narrow.

* **A focus on listening**: As a mentee, you’re better served by milking examples, ideas and learnings out of your mentor, and then leveraging your mentor to help apply them to your space

* **Transparency**: It may take a few meetings to build the trust necessary to give this type of candid feedback, but try to get there quickly

* **Dissolved appropriately**: A mentee shouldn’t be afraid to explicitly dial down the frequency of meetings or stop them entirely.

## Project & Performance Metrics

### Project Metrics

* Set up a regular cadence to interview people (every week [Reach] or every two weeks)
* Come up with a SOP for research, contact, interview, analysis, document

### Performance Metrics

* **Experience Harvesting / Data Driven Planning**
	* Figure out at least 1 critical skill for DS
	* Have a better picture of how DS field is sub-divided into other fields
	* Stack rank which sub-field you have the highest chance of impact and success

* **Build my network**
	* The network should be large and close enough that I can manage to invite a sizable chunk of time to a DS meetup

* **Seek Mentors**
	* Identify a narrow set of candidates as mentors
	* Reach: Start a mentor-mentee relationship with one person
