Most of my conversation with Silvanus is quite personal, so I will not share the details here. However, there were several take aways that I thought are helpful:

* **On Reading**
	* [Social Capital]: He pays a lot of attention to their articles and the way they think
	* He also think Social Capital has a really odd [core value list], but he thinks an ambitious person should have some of those characteristics
	* He also recommend this [article] which describe how technology are built on top of each layer of foundation
	* Read, reflect, and always come up with your own perspective on things

* **On Management**
	* High Output Management By Andy Grove. Everyone keeps recommending this book, I should definitely read this
	* He also considered himself a extremely good recruiter, and sharing his vision and passion. He is always able to hire very good people to work with/for him. In some sense, he is an enabler
	* For Management, it's good to know how to do context switching extremely fast, because there are always different things going on with each person. He doubt that this is something that can be learned though, he is naturally very good at this

* **On Skills**
	* Don't underestimate having depth, he could never be the CTO of a AI, Drone company, but maybe I can if I build depth
	* He always strive for breath than depth, and small companies are better for this.

* **On Assets**
	* People and Network is the most important. For example, VCs know a lot of people, and it's self perpetuating that they find good people and good companies
	* VCs are also several SD above the mean in terms of intelligence, so if you want to be in that environment, need to be very sharp
	* Apparently there is a thing called Talent List amongst the VC circles

* **Other Suggestions**
	* Always have a investment thesis about anything interesting
	* Be able to do pattern matching very well
	* Don't assign values to people in your network, focus on building a healthy nice network. Good things can happen
	* Read a lot
