# For tomorrow's chat

I would focus on the theme of creating public work, but make extension to doing good work, and finding the time. I would ask him how he hone his skills, and I would ask him how he find the time. 


Hi Dave,

Thank you for your words of encouragement, it definitely makes me want to write more :)

Would you mind providing me a list of three dates (in the order of your preference) for either this week or next? We will finalize the schedule by the next email. I want to make sure our conversation is mutually beneficial, so I will be more than happy to share my perspective as well.

As promised, below is a list of questions that I have in mind, but we don't need to limit the conversation to these questions.
On honing technical skills: In your post, you mentioned knowing more about statistics & knowing less about software engineering, I was and still am in the same situation. I am curious to learn about your strategies in balancing your learnings in these areas. More specifically:
How do you identify the most critical skills to hone in order to be successful as a DS? 
Are your learnings largely driven by interests, by work projects, or other motivating factors?
How do you practice them so you can deliberately get better at these skills?
For me, I try to deliberately practice skills I want to learn, ideally through my day-to-day work. However, sometimes it is hard to know if I am making the right investments, because who wouldn't want to learn the next deep learning algorithm that would save the world :p

On creating public work: I am still amazed by the depth and breath of your public works - R books, R courses, R packages, blog posts, and public presentations and talks. I know a lot of them you have created over the years, not just during your times at Stack Overflow, but I am still amazed by how prolific and efficient you are.
How do you balance between making public works, personal learnings, and your day-to-day responsibilities at Stack Overflow? 
Essentially, how do you optimize your time for each of these respective activities?
Finally, what's the biggest lessons you have learned from creating public work?

On connecting with other data scientists: You are very good at connecting with the DS community, both online or offline. Only recently I've started to attend conferences (like useR! at Stanford), and they are truly eye-opening. A lot of these activities remind me of graduate students going to academic conferences, promoting their own works and learning from others (Andrej Karpathy talked a little about this here). 
What are some of the things you learned to meaningfully engage with the DS community, online or offline? 

Apology in advance if the questions seem a bit tactical, but you seem to be doing a lot of the right things and I am curious to learn about your experience :) 

Best
