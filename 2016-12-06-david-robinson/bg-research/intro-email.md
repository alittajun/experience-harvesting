Hi David, 

My name is Robert Chang, a big fan of yours and your blog Variance Explained. I just want to say THANK YOU for sharing your one year experience as a Data Scientist at Stack Overflow. It's a really insightful piece (more details below) and I think many aspiring Data Scientists can benefit from your words of wisdom.

First of all, it's humbling to see that even for very well educated individuals like you, sometimes career decisions are made not only by deliberate consideration, but also influenced by seemingly small altruistic contribution that turned out to be life changing. You reflected on this point and concluded that "public work is not a waste of time", and I cannot agree more. I cannot emphasize how many times I have benefited from countless great answers on Stack Overflow, Quora, and the like and wished I had written one myself.

Another observation is that just creating public work is not enough, the work itself needs to be high quality, and its quality is rooted in the years of training and deliberate practice. I am so amazed by your past and current projects, including Broom and especially those that evangelize and teach R to the public (like this course and this book). When you do great work, there is a much higher chance that its value will be disseminated to people, and usually unexpected things (often good ones) will happen.

I have not accomplished nearly as much as you have during my time as a Data Scientist, but I did experience something similar where I shared my thoughts on being a Data Scientist at Twitter. Surprisingly, I got a lot of good feedbacks from other people who can echo with me. It's an amazing feeling.

To summarize, I think creating public work is often an extension of the desire to consistently deliver great work, and I am dedicated to improve my craft and the fundamentals be become a good Data Scientist. And I think the best way to do so is to learn from people who I admire and can look up to. You are definitely one of them! 

As a result, I was hoping to conduct an informational interview with you and learn more
about how you become so good at what you do. I understand your time is valuable, so I will be happy to send you a list of targeted questions ahead of time to make our conversation more productive. Looking forward to hear back from you!

Best
