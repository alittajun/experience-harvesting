Conversation with David Robinson
================================

Creating public work is not a waste of time
===========================================
For him, a lot of Ph.Ds, and a lot of graduate students, have this mindset that what they know is too specialized,
or too estoteric, and so they don't share their knowledge to other people. This often makes Ph.Ds less effective as 
communicators.

In fact, this is an assumption, and often than not it's not true. A lot of people WOULD appreciate your public work, and your sharing of knowledge. You should think about in terms of this is knowledge people should and want to know, so I am going to share it, no matter how trivial.

The way he structured his blog varianced explained is that he treats his intended audience as college students, he craft
the explanations in simple terms and really hone in to the point. This makes him a clear communicator, because he thinks about how to deliver the messages.

For David, he goes a step beyond and said that you should ask yourself why your work shouldn't be public work.

Tactics and Strategy
====================
Over the years, he has been focusing a lot on the question-to-answer cycle, he would focus on tactics that can make this loop shorter and shorter, and he would identify things that he needs to do over and over again, and automate those process. I think this is an important mindset that most of us do not have, and needs to be start doing. He mentioned that his tactics are tidying dataset.

Strategy is about creating artifcats (?): He argued that whatever, however small things you do, there should be artifacts associated with your work. Some are internal (sending the result to the slack channel), some are external (he use Rpubs a lot, and he put his code up there so people can refer to how he did things). Whatever you do, you should create artifacts, I think to 1) deliver values 2) to promote your work.

Some people are good at internal artifacts, some people are better at public artificat, you have to figure it out. Write more personal R packages, contribute to public R packages, use Broom, and attend conferences.

Goals Changes, But Effectiveness Do Not
=======================================
He mentioned about when he transitioned from academia to the industry, a lot of the metrics used to evaluate a person is no longer relevant. Obviously those metrics are important while you are in the game, but in the long haul, it's those things that make you a more productive person that pays off big time. Optimize your own scalability, it's insanely good use of time.

When Hiring For People, Hire For The Second Derivatives
=======================================================
He mentioned about Stanford's professor on hiring. Should you hire someone with a high intercept, or a high slope. Intercept represents experience, and slope represent skill/personal growth. Ultimately, slope is more important than intercept, so focusing on slope is important when hiring people.

David wants to go one step beyond, he argue that we should hire people based on their second derivative, that is the skill and the ability that you are able to bootstrap yourself to make your self better, and a higher rate over time. I think this is a critical mindset, and a much higher bar. And scalability mind for oneself again, is important for this.
