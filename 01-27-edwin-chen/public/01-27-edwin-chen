### Q: You are obviously a very versatile DS - you know a lot of topics and were able to apply many of them to your projects or jobs. Do you have a process of translating techniques into insights?

_I read a lot and like to learn new things even if they're not immediately useful, and I have a good memory, so sometimes when I see an interesting big problem I'll just think of something I read or learned about a while ago. If a technique is useful, I often end up randomly seeing applications everywhere._

_He also mentioned a great point that it's probably more effective to learn skills 'on the job' since you are guided by the problem. It's a lot harder to fit techniques into problems because they might not be the best techniques, and fixated at a hammer while ignoring the nail is not good._


### Q: What's your view on 'correlation does not equal causation'? How can we do better at causal inference?

_He agrees that it's not enough to just throw this statement as a caveat. There are techniques (check Joshua Angrist) that can better measure causality, and the skills are worth learning for. He definitely encourage me to study more, but don't just read the techniques - try to apply them._

### Q: What's your view on the dichotomy of Type A v.s. Type B Data Scientist?

_He thinks in addition to Type A, and Type B, there is also Type C - causality and experimentation. Not really building system, but working to build the statistical aspect / intelligence of an internal tool._

_He also disagree that Type B DS typically are more well recognized or their works are more valuable. Type A work can be super impactful if focus on 'scalable analysis'/10X project. What he means is that the insight you come up with will change many surface areas where people work. e.g. Changing a particular overall metric can change how we report things, how machine learning models are optimizing for...etc. The important thing is not so much about what type you are, but how much leverage does your work has._

_As a side note, even though he is super talented at both (a rare breed), he actually enjoys even more doing type A work because it's a more creative, artsy process. It also helps because he likes to understand things. Type B is always a bit more standardized, you just do the steps that's required._
